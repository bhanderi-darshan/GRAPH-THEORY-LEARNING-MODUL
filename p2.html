    <p><h2> 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
        Finds the shortest path from a source to all vertices in a weighted graph by exploring the nearest unvisited vertex and updating distances.
        
        <br>2. Kruskal's Algorithm
        Constructs a minimum spanning tree by sorting edges by weight and adding them without forming cycles until all vertices are connected.
        
        <br> 3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
        Explores a graph layer by layer, starting from a source vertex, visiting all neighbors, and ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
